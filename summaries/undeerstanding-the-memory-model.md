# Understanding the memory model

## What is Memory?
Memory is just storage in a computer and this can be in the form of hard drive or RAM.

## Hard Drive
A program stored in the hard drive takes a longer time to be executed.
This program is not volatile, that is, it persists even after the computer
has been shutdown.

## RAM
A program stored in the RAM takes a shorter time to be executed.
This program is volatile and does not persist after the computer has been shut down.

## Byte?
We can see byte as the unit memory is measured in.
The maximum number we can represent using one byte is 256.
To represent characters, we map them with numbers. this is the basis for the ASCII table.

## Addresses
An address helps us access the data or information that has been stored in memory.
The smallest accessible unit of memory is a byte.

## Array
The elements in an array are stored contiguously in memory.

## Linked List
The blocks in a linked list are not stored contiguously in memory.
Each block contains a value and the address in memory of the next item.
